  <h1>Whispers</h1>
  <h2><em>"Trust no one. Not even yourself."</em></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Whispers</strong> is a mind-breaking, physics-driven VR horror-action experience for up to 4 players. 
    Trapped in a fractured world of shifting realities and cryptic voices, you and your friends must rely on each other — or so you think.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across 10 intense story-rich levels, hallucinations will twist your perceptions, bones will break, limbs will be lost, 
    and robotic replacements will be your only hope. But the worst part isn’t the pain — it’s the whispers. The voices. 
    The terrifying idea that even your teammates might not be who they say they are.
  </p>

  <p><strong>🧩 Key Features include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>👥 4-Player VR Co-op with AI-generated psychological manipulation</li>
    <li>🩸 Realistic damage system (break bones, lose limbs, install robotic prosthetics)</li>
