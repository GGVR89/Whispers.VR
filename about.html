  <h1>About Whispers</h1>
  <p>
    Whispers is a VR horror-action game with a heavy focus on physics-based gameplay, multiplayer co-op, and psychological horror. 
    The story revolves around a fractured world where reality blurs, and your trust is constantly tested.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designed primarily for 4-player VR co-op, the game features realistic injury and damage systems, ghost mechanics, and an AI that learns to manipulate players psychologically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The singleplayer mode with a different story is planned for after the multiplayer release.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Inspirations:</strong> Bonelab, The Forest, Phasmophobia, SOMA, Observer.
